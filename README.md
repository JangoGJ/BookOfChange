# BookOfChange
This program is my first text for graduate task.
So it only apply to learn Chinese ancient philosophy.
**Not to business,please.**
***Thanks to Professor Fu Peirong. ***
I have revised his book <Fu Perong's translation of I-Ching> unexplained.
There were point of view maybe unsuitable for this program. That's all my fault.
If you find a mistake, please sent me an email.
