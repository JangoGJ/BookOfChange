# BookOfChange
This program is my first text for graduate task.<br>
So it only apply to learn Chinese ancient philosophy.<br>

**Not to business,please.**

***Thanks to Professor Fu Peirong.***

I have revised his book <Fu Perong's translation of I-Ching> unexplained.<br>
There were point of view maybe unsuitable for this program. That's all my fault.<br>
If you find a mistake, please sent me an email.<br>
